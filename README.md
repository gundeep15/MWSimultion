# MWSimultion
How many people does it take to start a stadium wave (popularly known as the Mexican Wave)? This simulation has been recreated from the 2002 [Nature Brief Communication paper] (https://www.nature.com/articles/419131a) by Viscek group (Hungary) that attempted to answer the question. The problem is posted as an interesting collective human behavior problem. 

The mathematical model is a Markovian state transition model, but one that accounts for excitability of the states. Thresholds on the transition rates decide whether the individual can get excited or not. Initial excitations are however performed as being equivalent to system perturbations.
